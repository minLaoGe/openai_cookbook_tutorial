GENERAL PRINCIPLES     Scope     1.1     These Power Unit Financial Regulations come into force on 1 January 2023. They form part of   the terms and conditions for the homologation of Power Units to be supplied to F1 Teams for   participation in the Championship from 2026 onwards. Each Power Unit Manufacturer   intending to homologate Power Units for supply to an F1 Team(s) for participation in the   Championship from 2026 onwards agrees to be bound by, and undertakes to comply with,   these Power Unit Financial Regulations from the start of its N-3 Full Year Reporting Period.     Objectives     1.2     These Power Unit Financial Regulations introduce a Power Unit Cost Cap that limits certain   costs that may be incurred by or on behalf of a Power Unit Manufacturer in each Full Year   Reporting Period, while leaving that Power Unit Manufacturer free to decide how to allocate   resources within that Power Unit Cost Cap.     1.3     These Power Unit Financial Regulations are designed to help achieve the following objectives   (the ""Objectives""):     (a)     (b)     (c)     to promote the long-term competitive balance of the Championship in respect of   Power Units      to promote the long-term sporting fairness of the Championship in respect of Power   Units  and     to ensure the long-term financial stability and sustainability of the Power Unit   Manufacturers,     while preserving the unique technology and engineering challenge of Formula 1.     1.4     1.5     These Power Unit Financial Regulations will be interpreted and applied by the Cost Cap   Administration, the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel and the ICA in a consistent manner that treats   all Power Unit Manufacturers equally and that advances the Objectives.     The definitive version of these Power Unit Financial Regulations is the English version, which   will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Defined words and phrases in   these Power Unit Financial Regulations (denoted by initial capital letters) have the meaning   indicated in Appendix 1 to these Power Unit Financial Regulations, unless otherwise defined   in the body of these Power Unit Financial Regulations.

Not specified,"(c)     Research and Development costs:     (d)     Capitalisation of Power Units:     If a Reporting Group Entity has capitalised any costs in respect of a Power Unit during   the Reporting Period, an adjustment must be made in the calculation of Relevant Costs   to ensure such costs are recognised within the Reporting Period in which they are   incurred.     (e)     Capital Expenditure:     The amount (if any) by which the Capital Expenditure Amount for the Full Year   Reporting Period exceeds the Capital Expenditure Limit must be included in   the calculation of Relevant Costs.     If the costs incurred as part of a Related Party Transaction, Exchange   Transaction or F1 Team Transaction meet the definition of paragraphs (a) or   (b) of the definition of Capital Expenditure, such costs must be included in   Capital Expenditure at not less than Fair Value.     (f)     Inventories:     If the accounting treatment of Inventories within Total Costs of the Reporting   Group varies from the following requirements, the Power Unit Manufacturer   must make an adjustment in the calculation of Relevant Costs to reflect these   requirements:     (A)     the cost of an item of Used Inventories must be recognised in full as   an expense in the Full Year Reporting Period in which it was first used   in respect of the Power Unit Manufacturer’s Power Units, provided     Formula 1 Power Unit Financial Regulations   © 2022 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile        9                    16 August 2022     Issue 1     (B)     (C)     (A)     (B)     (B)     (C)          that where such use occurs prior to 1 January of its N-3 Full Year   Reporting Period and the item is re-used during the N-3 Full Year   Reporting Period, the cost of that item of Used Inventories must be   recognised in full as an expense in the N-3 Full Year Reporting Period      the cost of an item of Unused Inventories must not be recognised in   the Reporting Period  and     the cost of an item of Redundant Inventories (which has not been   recognised in a previous Full Year Reporting Period pursuant to any   other provision of this Article 4.1(f)(i)) must be recognised in full as an   expense in the Reporting Period. Where practicable, the identification   of Redundant Inventories must be carried out on an item-by-item   basis. Otherwise, groups of similar items may be considered together.     (ii)     The cost of an item of Inventories must comprise:     all costs of purchase, determined on the same basis as that used by   the Power Unit Manufacturer   its Audited Annual Financial   Statements in respect of the previous Full Year Reporting Period      in     costs of conversion (including fixed production overheads allocated on   a basis that is appropriate to the nature of the product and method of   production and on the basis of the entity's normal level of activity, and   applied consistently from one Reporting Period to another)  and     (C)     other costs incurred in bringing the item of Inventories to its present   location and condition.     (iii)      In the event that an item of Redundant Inventories:     (A)     has not been used  and     is not of a technical specification that is specific to the Power Units   supplied to either the Nominated Team or any one Customer Team of   the Power Unit Manufacturer  and     its cost has been recognised in full as an expense in the Reporting   Period pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) of this Article,     the aggregate cost of all such items must be allocated on an equal pro-rata   basis across the Nominated Team and each Customer Team of the Power Unit   Manufacturer. The Power Unit Manufacturer must then make a downward   adjustment in the calculation of Relevant Costs for the Reporting Period equal   to the aggregate amount allocated to the Customer Teams.     (iv)     In the event that an item of Redundant Inventories written off in a previous   Reporting Period pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) of this Article is used in a   subsequent Reporting Period, the Power Unit Manufacturer must make an   adjustment in the calculation of Relevant Costs for that subsequent Reporting     Formula 1 Power Unit Financial Regulations   © 2022 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile        10                    16 August 2022     Issue 1          Period to add an amount equal to that written off in the previous Reporting   Period.     (g)     Unrecorded costs or losses:     If costs or losses incurred by a Reporting Group Entity are not recognised within its   Total Costs, which under the applicable accounting standards should have been   recognised within profit or loss during the Reporting Period, an adjustment must be   made in the calculation of Relevant Costs to ensure such costs are recognised within   Relevant Costs for the Reporting Period.     (h)     Foreign exchange transaction costs:     (i)     (ii)     (i)     (ii)     (i)     Subject to Article 4.1(h)(ii), if a Reporting Group Entity incurs a cost for a   transaction in a currency other than the Power Unit Manufacturer’s   Presentation Currency, the Power Unit Manufacturer may choose to make an   adjustment in the calculation of Relevant Costs to reflect the difference   between such cost retranslated   into the Power Unit Manufacturer’s   Presentation Currency using the Applicable Rate, and the value at which those   costs were recorded on initial recognition within Total Costs of the Reporting   Group.     If a Power Unit Manufacturer chooses to make such an adjustment, it must be   made for all costs within Total Costs of the Reporting Group that have been   transacted in all currencies other than the Power Unit Manufacturer’s   Presentation Currency, unless any such costs have otherwise been excluded   from Total Costs of the Reporting Group pursuant to Article 3.     (i)     Eligible External Manufacturing Costs:     If a Power Unit Manufacturer has recognised Eligible External Manufacturing Costs   within Total Costs of the Reporting Group, it must make a downward adjustment in   the calculation of Relevant Costs equal to 35% of any Eligible External Manufacturing   Costs recognised, subject to a maximum amount of:     US Dollars 20,000,000 in respect of each of the Full Year Reporting Periods   ending on 31 December 2023, 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2025,   adjusted for Indexation  and     US Dollars 30,000,000, adjusted for Indexation, in respect of the Full Year   Reporting Period ending on 31 December 2026 and in respect of each   subsequent Full Year Reporting Period.
